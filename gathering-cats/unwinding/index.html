<p>The professors never ceased to be amazed, and the honors and awards continued to pour in. The soft purr of the radiator next to me kept me in a suspended state of lucidity, where I navigated a complex relm of equations that my fully conscious mind would have stumbled over, taking hours to grasp. Without the hum of the furnace, I was a B minus student at best.</p>

	<p>The other gift... deception.</p>

<p>Everything was great, but then the little headaches began.  They were minor. Most days I found that wearing a hat or head band made them stay away.  My roommate thought I was crazy because I ended up looking like Bjorn from ABBA most mornings.</p>

<hr><br>

<p>"Would you reconsider if I told you I had a brain tumor and only two months left to live?"  Of course, it would be a lie, but I'm never one short of trying.</p>

<p>"What? You have a brain tumor?"</p>

<p>"I'm lying, I think. At least I don't really know.  Sometimes I wonder.  Would you reconsider if I did?"</p>

<p>I'll never know why the line worked with Tess. We've been together ever since.</p>

<p>Years later, I got up late at night, drank a cup of water, laid back on the coach, and then in one instant, the focus headache was gone. Like the flipping of a switch. I'd been dehydrated all those years.</p>

<p>My advice to young writers, drink water.</p>

	<p>Winding home from another crazy-busy Friday night of lugging cheap beer across sticky floors, my whole buddy was worn out. I was looking forward to curling up with a good book to lull my mind to sleep. Steven arrived home shortly after I did.  He parked his jeep in the back. Hugging him at the door, I reached around to grab a bite from the big bag of cinnamon bread from the deli next door, he'd traded two dozen thick slices and they'd thrown in a big jar of fig jam for tomorrow's breakfast.</p>

	<p>Steve and I had been dating off and on for most of the previous five years.  He was both a mentor, an employer and a security blanket.  He'd taken over the pizzeria shortly after his dad died, rescuing it from oblivion, while I rescued him from the loss of his father. We were good for eachother, but not bound at the hip.</p>

	<p>There's one book I've been looking forward to every night this week, The Artisan. Funny thing though, I usually fall asleep after only a few pages.</p>

	<p>I flip to where I left off.</p>

	<p>Before long I'm yawning, I'm already drifting. But that's why I came here, for the dreams that soon follow.</p>

	<p>I arrived at work the next day around noon, grabbed my old black sneakers from the cubby and started cleaning up from the night before. A drawing fell out of a paper bag holding a screenplay my friend Jen gave me two days prior. The black lines on it formed a cool pattern. I slid it into my back pocket, moving quickly to get to work.</p>

	<p>It was another busy night.  With the last customer gone, Nipsy was up on the counter. Her paw jerked back and forth as she tried desperately to unsnarl a ball of yarn caught in her claws. The tips were good, so I didn't mind the late hours, at least until the winter is over back home.  Then I'll need to get myself organized, and turn over a new leaf.</p>
