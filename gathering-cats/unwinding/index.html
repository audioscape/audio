<p>The professors never ceased to be amazed, and the honors and awards continued to pour in. The soft purr of the radiator next to me kept me in a suspended state of lucidity, where I navigated a complex relm of equations that my fully conscious mind would have stumbled over, taking hours to grasp. Without the hum of the furnace, I was a B minus student at best.</p>

	<p>The other gift... deception.</p>

<p>Everything was great, but then the little headaches began.  They were minor. Most days I found that wearing a hat or head band made them stay away.  My roommate thought I was crazy because I ended up looking like Bjorn from ABBA most mornings.</p>

<p>"Would you reconsider if I told you I had a brain tumor and only two months left to live?"  Of course, it would be a lie, but I'm never one short of trying.</p>

<p>"What? You have a brain tumor?"</p>

<p>"I'm lying, I think. At least I don't really know.  Sometimes I wonder.  Would you reconsider if I did?"</p>

<p>I'll never know why the line worked with Tess. We've been together ever since.</p>

<p>Years later, I got up late at night, drank a cup of water, laid back on the coach, and then in one instant, the focus headache was gone. Like the flipping of a switch. I'd been dehydrated all those years.</p>

<p>My advice to young writers, drink water.</p>

<p>"There can be no pleasure like the one unknown." - Aurora Steel, that's me.</p>

<p>We were worn, like ragged sandals saved way to long after the Dead were long dead.  Winding home from another crazy-busy Friday night of serving cheap beer on sticky floors, I was looking forward to curling up with a good book to lull my mind to sleep. Steven arrived home shortly after I did.  He parked his jeep in the back. Hugging him, I reached around to grab a bite from the big bag of zucinni bread from with the deli next door, he'd traded two dozen thick slices and they'd through in a big jar of fig jam for tomorrow's breakfast.</p>

<p>Steve and I had been dating off and on for most of the previous five years.  He was both a mentor, an employer and a security blanket.  He'd taken over the pizzeria shortly after his father died, rescuing it from oblivion, while I rescued him from the loss of his dad. We were good for eachother, but not bound at the hip.</p>

<p>There's one book I've been looking forward to every night this week, The Artisan. Funny thing though, I usually fall asleep after only a few pages.</p>

<p>I flip to where I left off.</p>

<p>Before long I'm yawning, I'm already drifting. But that's why I came here, for the dreams that soon follow.</p>

<p>I arrive at work the next day around noon, grab my old black sneakers from the cubby and start cleaning up from the night before. A drawing falls out of a paper bag holding a manuscript that my friend Jen gave me two days prior. The black lines form a skull pattern on a tan piece of paper. I slide it into my back pocket, I'm moving quickly to get to work.</p>

<p>Another busy night.  The last customer was gone. Nipsy sat on the counter, her paw moving back and forth as she tried to unsnarl the ball of yarn caught on her claw. The tips are good, so I don't mind, at least until the winter is over back home.  Then I need to get myself organized, turn over a new leaf.</p>
